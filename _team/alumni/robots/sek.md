He started out running ROS Fuerte over Ubuntu Precise, later moving on to Hydra. The ROS nodes for his IMU and Roboteq motor controller were developed by Andreas. His first task was collecting audio-visual and laser range data for experiments on speaker diarization, cooperating with Theodoros Giannakopoulos in the AVISPIRE project. He then helped Charalambos with his thesis project on navigation.

Sek also helped Giorgos with his thesis on Racing Robot Path Planning. This work was the basis for the race robot show that Sek was giving on Researchersâ€™ Nights and the NCSR School Visits programme until his retirement at the end of the 2016-17 school season.
