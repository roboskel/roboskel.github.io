<!--# An overview of our research. -->

Roboskel aims at developing the robot capabilities needed for socially-aware robotic behavior, including:
1. awareness of the human actions and intentions in common workspaces, 
2. transparent robot actions, 
3. collaborative learning,  
4. navigation and motion planning for safely and fluently sharing space with humans. 

We evaluate our methods in real-time, physical world test scenarios and we use ROS to deploy Î¿ur methods on different robots, including UGVs, arms, and, more recently, UAVs. 


<!--We value our long experience in ROS-based prototype development as it allows us to both benefit from and contribute to the wealth of robotics software components available for ROS. This places us in a position where our long research experience is combined with the practical skills that turn ideas into innovative solutions.-->
