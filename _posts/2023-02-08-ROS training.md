<img src="/images/posts/ros-training-banner.jpg" height="400">

We are really excited for organising our first ROS training!!! 

Roboskel organises its first online training for Robot Operating System (ROS2). Participants will be introduced to fundamental ROS concepts, and will be able to create their own system of autonomous navigation by participating in a kart race challenge. Which kart will win?

The training starts on 13 March 2023.
