He started out running ROS Fuerte over Ubuntu Precise, later moving on
to Hydra. The ROS nodes for his IMU and Roboteq motor controller was
developed by Andreas Lydakis.
His first task was collecting audio-visual and laser range data for
experiments on speaker diarization, cooperating with Theodoros
Giannakopoulos in the AVISPIRE project. He then helped
Charalambos Rossides with Charalambos’ thesis project on navigation.
<br /><br />
Sek also helped
<a href="/personnel/gstavrinos">Giorgos</a> with Giorgos’
thesis on <em>Racing Robot Path Planning</em>. This work was
the basis for the <em>race robot</em> show Sek has given innumerable times
on Researchers’ Nights and the NCSR School Visits programme,
until his retirement in 2017.
