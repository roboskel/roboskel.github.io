<!--This demonstration aims to show specific technological advancements that enable cognitive based robots to perceive and understand natural human behavior as well as to act in ways that are familiar to humans. The demonstration is built around a museum guide use-case, where a simulated robotic guide is operating in a virtual environment. During the demonstration visitors are able to interact with the simulated robot using natural language. At the same time, videos of a real robot operating in a real museum are also demonstrated. -->
