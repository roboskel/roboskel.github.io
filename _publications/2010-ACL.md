<!--An enduring challenge in human-
computer interaction (HCI) research is the
creation of natural and intuitive interfaces.
Besides the obvious requirement that such
interfaces communicate over modalities
such as natural language (especially spo-
ken) and gesturing that are more natural
for humans, exhibiting affect and adaptiv-
ity have also been identified as important
factors to the interfaceâ€™s acceptance by the
user. In the work presented here, we pro-
pose a novel architecture for affective and
multimodal dialogue systems that allows
explicit control over the personality traits
that we want the system to exhibit. More
specifically, we approach personality as
a means of synthesising different, and
possibly conflicting, adaptivity models
into an overall model to be used to drive
the interaction components of the system.
Furthermore, this synthesis is performed
in the presence of domain knowledge,
so that domain structure and relations
influence the results of the calculation.-->
