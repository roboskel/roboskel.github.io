<!--In this paper, we present an interactive learning and adapta-
tion framework that facilitates the adaptation of an interactive agent to
a new user. We argue that Interactive Reinforcement Learning methods
can be utilized and integrated to the adaptation mechanism, enabling the
agent to refine its learned policy in order to cope with different users.
We illustrate our framework with a use case in the domain of Robot
Assisted Therapy. We present our results of the learning and adaptation
experiments against different simulated users, showing the motivation
of our work and discussing future directions towards the definition and
implementation of our proposed framework.-->
